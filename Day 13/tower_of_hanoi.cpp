/* TOWER OF HANOI
// The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower[1] and sometimes pluralized as Towers) 
is a mathematical game or puzzle.It consists of three rods and a number 
of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat 
stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top,
thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod,obeying
the following simple rules:

1>Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top
of another stack or on an empty rod.
3>No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves 
required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1,where n is the number of disks.
