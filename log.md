* **Today's Progress:**   
1. The reverse of an array by the iterative method in C++.    
2. Some pattern problems solved using python.     
* **Thoughts:** It's the first day of the challenge taken by me on LinkedIn but the first day is not easy for me as I think, in the first day I am struggle with solving the basic array problem and finding the data structure problem on various site.but I will try my best and keep it up for maintain my consistency.
